Trying to improve the secure connection and the sniffing function by running multiple scenarios 
and removed the automation of wirshark launch to reduce terminal overlapping between ettercap and 
wireshark makes it easier to exit out of the function hopefully i will find a method to simplify 
the process of launching ettercap because it launches but its droping packets instead of 
retransmitting them so more reading on ettercap is needed to continue and also jay is 
gonna start learning emphaty and i am gonna run multiple simulations to see how he 
reacts to different emotional dialogues will be back with the results soon.

## log result 50% success rate has been achieved on this run

So i was thinking how to create linked neural networks like how to create a neural network
that can take care of the input for another neural network and so on so i figured it out the dialogues
don't need to be taken care off manually they just need to recieve input from another neural network
and produce output for the other neural network and so on that will allow jays response to be more
efficient and precise his learning wont be automated but that is good cause he will only learn what
i teach him the only downside is that he will not get smart fast he will get smart thou.

I also noticed that every model needs to be trained at the begining of the program because if we use some
other method there will be a training sequence at each function call and that will make jay so slow so i will
trade off slow boot time for faster execution and still doing research into how to make him sound better and
also hear and soon we will be up and running with the vision system and that will allow jay to have much better
functions like recognizing my presence and also not executing any functions for someone else i guess much
more security for angel protocol and also i am planning on encrypting my messages from now on and the next
version of jay will be started in about a week with much more complexity and preplanning done.

## log result testing on this version of jay will continue on but will also break down thsi version and start
    taking out requirements abilities and create a pseudo model of the next version

## version 2.0 planning will start WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2022 see ya then

Yessssssss, so first test for multiple intents has worked and we are ready for the planning stage next step
is create an architecture and setup a file structure for avoiding circular import and load overflow get to
work amigo!!!

## log result test has been completed and we are ready for getting to work but still needs more testing before
    actually applying it to JAY 2.0

Second phase testing completed and jay keeps showing promise the intents are perfectly feeding eachother and no
circular import problem yet can't wait to start the planning soon will start on working on JAY 2.0 and plan on
having a first release by the first month or June 17 hopefully

## log result second round of test has been completed and is succesful a few more tests and planning can
    start
